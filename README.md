# bokeh_visualization
Visualization of deep learning training data

This code allows you to show an interactive plot of your training/valiudation losses and to show some result images from your train/valudation. First the Bokeh server should be running.

#### Start Bokeh server
To start the bokeh (version 0.10):
```
bokeh-server
```

#### How to use in your code
The code is only one file with one class: visualize_data.py. The file contains a main with an example of how to use the class.


#### TODO list
- [x] Create the tool
- [ ] Test in real training
- [ ] Add a thread
